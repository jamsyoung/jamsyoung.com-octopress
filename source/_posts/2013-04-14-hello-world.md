I have switched blogging software (and hosting) yet again.  This time I have
moved to [Octopress][6].  I really like it better than all the others I have
tried in the past.  I didn't bother porting over all my old posts from the last
WordPress blog that I had.  You can still get to them all at
[http://jamsyoung.wordpress.com/][7].  I have moved over only the ones that got
significant traffic.

Here are my other online profiles that I keep up.

- [GitHub][0]

- [LinkedIn][1]

- [Google+][2]

- [StackOverflow][3]

- [Careers 2.0][4] (by StackOverflow)

- [npmjs.org][5]
