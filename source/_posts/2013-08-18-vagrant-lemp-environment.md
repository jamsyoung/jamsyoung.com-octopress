For a quick LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) environment you can use Vagrant and
Virtualbox.  I wrote about this [previously][0] when I created an environemnt
tailored to Wordpress.  Since then I have modified that and made it more generic
for any PHP / MySQL development.  Feel free to fork the GitHub repo and use it.
