This release contains minor dependency updates.

<https://github.com/jamsyoung/log-notify/compare/0.1.1...0.1.2>

Available via:

- NPM: <https://npmjs.org/package/log-notify>
- GitHub: <https://github.com/jamsyoung/log-notify/tree/0.1.2>

This does NOT fix the problem of notifications not working on OS X 10.9
Mavericks.  That fix is required in a dependency of log-notify that should
be released soon.

See <https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier/pull/60> for details.
