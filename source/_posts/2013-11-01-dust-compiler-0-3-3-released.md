This release fixes a defect when installing globally fails.

<https://github.com/jamsyoung/dust-compiler/compare/0.3.2...0.3.3>

Available via:

- NPM: <https://npmjs.org/package/dust-compiler>
- GitHub: <https://github.com/jamsyoung/dust-compiler/tree/0.3.3>

This does NOT fix the problem of notifications not working on OS X 10.9
Mavericks.  That fix is required in a dependency of dust-compiler that should
be released soon.

See <https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier/pull/60> for details.
